### Everyone is welcome! You don't have to be a Christian.

Allegheny Christian Outreach (ACO) is a large group _fellowship_
that helps students to know Jesus through a personal relationship with Him. Students help each other to live out their Christian faith on campus, in the classroom, in their fields and more.

_fellowship_ is a Christian word for being together and taking care of each other

ACO is a [Coalition for Christian Outreach (CCO)](https://ccojubilee.org) ministry,
advised by CCO staff member Mollie Little.

### Why do we meet in fellowship?
