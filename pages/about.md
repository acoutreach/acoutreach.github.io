### Everyone is welcome! You don't have to be a Christian.

Allegheny Christian Outreach (ACO) is a large group _fellowship_
that helps students to know and follow Jesus. Students help each other to deepen and live out their Christian faith on campus, in the classroom, in their fields and more.

_fellowship_ is a Christian word for being together and taking care of each other

ACO is a [Coalition for Christian Outreach (CCO)](https://ccojubilee.org) ministry,
advised by CCO staff member Mollie Little. The CCO is a campus ministry organization
that calls college students to serve Jesus Christ with their entire lives.
The CCO works with local congregations to develop students to be passionate leaders
who serve Jesus Christ in their studies, jobs, communities, and families.
