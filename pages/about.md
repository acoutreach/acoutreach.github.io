### Everyone is welcome! You don't have to be a Christian.

“And the master said to the servant, ‘Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled’” (Luke 14:23).

In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus tells a parable about a man who plans a great banquet, but when the day of the banquet comes, everyone who was invited makes excuses not to come. Instead of cancelling the banquet altogether the man sends his servant to invite the ones nobody would want at a banquet. He wants his house to be full of guests.

God wants His banquet to be full too, but His banquet is not just one night, it is a party that will last for eternity! The invitation to God’s ultimate party comes through Jesus Christ, who sacrificed His life so that we can be in a relationship with God right now and at the party. When Jesus returns to Earth and everything is restored to the glory that it is intended to have, God’s party will start and He wants you to be there so He can share His goodness with you. All you have to do to be at the party is accept the invitation, accept Jesus! 

Join us at ACO as we seek to live in the hope and excitement of this ultimate party and experience little reflections of it together each day.

Allegheny Christian Outreach (ACO) is a large group fellowship
_(fellowship is a Christian word for being together and taking care of each other)_
that helps students to know and follow Jesus. Students help each other to
deepen and live out their Christian faith on campus, in the classroom, in their
fields and more.



ACO is a [Coalition for Christian Outreach (CCO)](https://ccojubilee.org) ministry,
advised by CCO staff member Mollie Little. The CCO is a campus ministry organization
that calls college students to serve Jesus Christ with their entire lives.
The CCO works with local congregations to develop students to be passionate leaders
who serve Jesus Christ in their studies, jobs, communities, and families.

We explore and live out our faith through:

- Bible Study
- Engaging Speakers
- Worship
- Fall Retreat
- Service
- Small Groups
- [Jubilee Conference](https://www.jubileeconference.com)
- And MORE!
