### Everyone is welcome! You don't have to be a Christian.

Allegheny Christian Outreach (ACO) is a large group fellowship
_(fellowship is a Christian word for being together and taking care of each other)_
that helps students to know and follow Jesus. Students help each other to
deepen and live out their Christian faith on campus, in the classroom, on the
field and more.



ACO is a [Coalition for Christian Outreach (CCO)](https://ccojubilee.org) ministry, advised by CCO staff member Mollie Little. The CCO is a campus ministry organization that calls
college students to serve Jesus Christ with their entire lives. The CCO works
with local congregations to develop students to be passionate leaders who serve Jesus Christ in their studies, jobs, communities, and families.

We explore and live out our faith through:
- Bible Study
- Engaging Speakers
- Worship
- Fall Retreat
- Service
- Small Groups
- [Jubilee Conference](https://www.jubileeconference.com)
