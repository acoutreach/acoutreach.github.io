### Everyone is welcome! You don't have to be a Christian.

Allegheny Christian Outreach (ACO) is a large group _fellowship_
that helps students to explore scripture, and to know and walk with God through a personal relationship with Jesus.
Students help each other live out their Christian faith on campus, in the classroom, in their fields and more.

(_fellowship_ is a Christian word for being together and taking care of each other)

ACO is a [Coalition for Christian Outreach (CCO)](https://ccojubilee.org) ministry,
advised by CCO staff member Mollie Little.

### Why do we meet in fellowship?

### Tuesdays at 8:30 in Ford Chapel

Throughout the 2021-2022 school year we are exploring the Gospel and looking at ethnicity and racethrough the lens of the Gospel
(aka good news!).
God created all things good - including ethnicity! Sin broke and twisted all things, including humanity, ethnicity, and race.
But Jesus came to heal and restore the broken things - our ethnicity and race included. We are excited to explore this
with each other and with you!

We are using the book [Beyond Colorblind](https://beyondcolorblind.com) as a resource as we delve into race and ethnicty together.
We have copies available for students who would like to read along!
